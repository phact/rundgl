.. warning:: Beware: rapidly changing documentation!

   This is the bleeding-edge documentation for Annotator that will be changing
   rapidly as we home in on Annotator v2.0. Information here may be inaccurate,
   prone to change, and otherwise unreliable. You may well want to consult `the
   stable documentation`_ instead.

Welcome to the documentation for Annotator, an open-source JavaScript library
for building annotation systems on the web. At its simplest, Annotator
enables textual annotations of any web page. You can deploy it using just a
few lines of code.

Annotator is also a library of composable tools for capturing and manipulating
DOM selections; storing, persisting and retrieving annotations; and creating
user interfaces for annotation. You may use few or many of these components
together to build your own custom annotation-based :term:`application`.
